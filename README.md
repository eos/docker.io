Docker files for EOS - A HEP Program for Flavor Observables
===========================================================

This repository keeps track of the source files used to create Docker images for EOS.
Presently we keep track of Ubuntu and manylinux2014 [images](https://hub.docker.com/r/eoshep/),
which have all build-time dependencies pre-installed.

We welcome bug fixes and additions.
